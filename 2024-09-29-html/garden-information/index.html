<h3>Roses - expert tips for gardening success</h3>
<p>Roses are universally beloved for their beauty and fragrance. However, successful rose gardening requires consideration of specific factors, including the selection of varieties, location, soil preparation, planting, maintenance, and potential companions.</p>
<ul>
    <li> There are thousands of rose varieties suitable for different climates and garden styles. Hybrid teas, floribundas, climbers, and shrub roses all offer distinct attributes. Research the best types for your local climate and personal preferences.</li>
    <li> Roses thrive in locations receiving 6-8 hours of sunlight daily. Soil should be rich, well-drained, and slightly acidic. Add compost or organic matter to enhance soil fertility and structure.</li>
    <li> Plant roses in a spacious hole, ensuring the bud union is at or slightly above ground level. Backfill with soil and water thoroughly</li>
       <li> Prune roses annually in early spring. Remove dead or diseased wood and thin out crowded growth to encourage airflow and reduce disease risk.</li>
<li> Consistent, deep watering is crucial, especially in dry conditions. Fertilize with a balanced rose formula at the beginning of the growing season and periodically thereafter.</li>
<li> Companion planting can enhance rose beauty and deter pests. Consider companions such as lavender, alliums, or marigolds.</li>
<li> Many roses are appreciated for their scent. Varieties such as ‘Mister Lincoln’ or ‘Gertrude Jekyll’ are renowned for their perfume.</li>

<h3>How to Grow Cacti</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Cacti need well-drained compost. Add one part grit to two parts multi-purpose compost.</li>
    <li> Cacti need lots of light so choose a sunny windowsill, conservatory or greenhouse.</li>
    <li>Observe the growing season, from the middle of March to the end of September. During this period give cacti a good watering and then let them dry out before you water again. Don’t let them sit in a wet saucer for long periods – a ‘soggy bottom’ could be fatal – and feed them occasionally with a liquid tomato fertiliser.</li>
       <li>During the rest of the year observe a cool winter rest (5°C is ideal) with no watering. </li>
       <li>Keep an eye out for pests such as mealy bugs or red spider mite and treat with an appropriate insecticide.</li>
    </ul>
