    <P>At its core, a programming language is a set of instructions that enables humans to communicate with computersâ€”using a series of symbols that serve as a bridge that allows humans to turn our ideas into instructions computers can understand. Like spoken languages, each language has its own unique syntax, structure, vocabulary, and even slang or shortcuts.</P>
