/**
 * <p>Deletes the queue specified by the <code>QueueUrl</code>, regardless of the queue's
 *             contents.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>Be careful with the <code>DeleteQueue</code> action: When you delete a queue, any
 *                 messages in the queue are no longer available. </p>
 *          </important>
 *          <p>When you delete a queue, the deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. Requests you
 *             send involving that queue during the 60 seconds might succeed. For example, a
 *                     <code>
 *                <a>SendMessage</a>
 *             </code> request might succeed, but after 60
 *             seconds the queue and the message you sent no longer exist.</p>
 *          <p>When you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue
 *             with the same name.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information,
 * see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-customer-managed-policy-examples.html#grant-cross-account-permissions-to-role-and-user-name">Grant
 * cross-account permissions to a role and a username</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *             <p>The delete operation uses the HTTP <code>GET</code> verb.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SQSClient, DeleteQueueCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sqs"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SQSClient, DeleteQueueCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sqs"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SQSClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteQueueRequest
 *   QueueUrl: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteQueueCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
